# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# com = ["Ibm", "TCS", "Wipro", "simform", "deollite"]
# adds = ["bokaro", "ahmedabad", "delhi", "punjab", "lucknow"]

# 8.times do |i|
#   Company.accessible_by(current_ability).create!(name: com[i], established_year: i+1, address: adds[i], user_id: i+1)
# end
